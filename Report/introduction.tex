A core function of the internet is the ability to switch network packets from one place to another using devices called routers and switches.
These devices recieve a packet, evaluate the destination, and output to the correct next hop rapidly.
These routers and switches are catagorized by their throughput, ranging from 10mbps (megabits per second) to 100gbps (gigabits per second).
It is common to see these marketed based on their throughput capabilites, with little to no information about what latency is present.
My goal is to create a piece of equipment which can measure this latency with precision ranging in the microseconds to nanoseconds.

Context: 
Computers are everywhere, networking is everywhere. Networking is a core part of how the internet works.
Internet Lag Explanation.
Measure this Lag.
Quick timing is hard
Measuring this time is hard.
Measuring currently doesnt happen.
I ma going to make a device that can measure this
Problem is that its really fast
So to measure this, it needs to be able to measure small fractions of a second.
Hence I am make a device that can do this.
