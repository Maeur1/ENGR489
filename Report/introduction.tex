A core function of the internet is the ability to switch network packets from one place to another using devices called routers and switches.
These devices recieve a packet, evaluate the destination, and output to the correct next hop rapidly.
These routers and switches are catagorized by their throughput, ranging from 10mbps (megabits per second) to 100gbps (gigabits per second).
It is common to see these marketed based on their throughput capabilites, with little to no information about what latency is present.
The goal is to create a piece of equipment which can measure this latency with precision ranging in the microseconds to nanoseconds.
