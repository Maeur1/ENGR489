\section{FPGA Design}

Continuing with the FPGA design, some work needs to be done. 
I have begun work on the block design required by the FPGA software. 
This block design will measure the time between two pulses, and store the value in memory.
Once this block is complete, it will need to be wired between two ethernet block designs (the ingress and egress ports).
This block will store the delta between two clock pulses into memory.
The memory location will then be accessible by the Linux operating system and then stored in a file, for examination.

\section{Testing}

The network engineering department at Victoria University has some network switches that I can test with my device.
These switches range from inexpensive basic switches from stores, to very expensive and fast switches for research.
I want to test these swtiches to compare the difference in latency of packets.
