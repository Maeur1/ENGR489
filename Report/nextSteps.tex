\section{FPGA Intellectual Property (IP) Creation}

\par A custom Intellectual Property block for the timing functions needs to be created. This will measure
the time taken between two ethernet ports, and store the value into a register which is accessible by
the ARM core present on the FPGA. This allows for ease of accessing through a Linux subsystem.

\section{Testing and Analysis of Results}

\par Once the timing system is functional, test will need to be done on network switches to measure the
packet timing. Analysis will then be done on the information to understand how some network
switches reduce latency compared with others.
