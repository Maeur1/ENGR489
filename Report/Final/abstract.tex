Fast internet connections are becoming more and more desired as high bandwidth media consumption and internet-based services grow in popularity. The speed of an internet connection can be separated into two distinct metrics,
latency, and bandwidth. The goal of this project is to create a device which can allow for flexible, high precision
network latency measurements. Current solutions are either flexible or not precise enough to allow for low
latency measurements. It was found that an FPGA would be a suitable device for the task, as the complexity of
allowing a flexible platform while also providing high-speed low-level access to electrical signals.
The device is currently a minimum viable product. The device can provide high resolution and
reliable timings in a flexible format. This device shows that hardware platforms can be both flexible and provide
reliable testing results. This device fills a gap in the market where no proprietary software is needed to accompany
the device for network packet analysis.
